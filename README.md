# EVM Smart Contracts Tools

A full-suite collection of useful Bash and JavaScript
programs and libraries to enable seamless development
of native computer applications designed to interact
with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible networks. 

Particular focus has been put onto giving users the ability
to seamlessly call publicly verified smart contracts functions
same as they would do to retrieve information from any other standard
local program.

In order to do so, the `evm-contract-call` program obtains networks'
informations from the
[EVM Chains Info](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-info)
and 
[EVM Chains Explorers](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-explorers)
programs and automatically retrieves eventually missing smart
contracts artifacts from online sources using the
[EVM Contracts ABI Get](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contracts-abi-get)
utility.

The `evm-contract-call` program uses the 
[Ethers](
  https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)
JavaScript library to
communicate with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible
blockchain networks and integrates natively with
and depends on the
[EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet),
but it's also possible to directly provide seeds files.

The tools are a required software dependency for
[libEVM](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libevm).

## Installation

The tools in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The collection has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-contracts-tools`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-contracts-tools
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evm-contracts-tools-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contracts-tools-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
